|--------|------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Low (480p) | 480p | 1.5 Mbps | 128 kbps | 30 fps |
| Standard (720p) | 720p | 2.5 Mbps | 128 kbps | 30 fps |


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not detected**
- Ensure USB camera is UVC-compatible
- Check USB-C hub or direct connection
- Grant camera permissions in iOS Settings
- Note: iPhone support not officially tested due to lack of test device

**Camera power issues / Insufficient power**
- Some cameras (especially professional cameras like Sony a7M4) may require more power than iPad can provide
- Use a **powered USB-C hub** that connects to external power source
- Connect both the camera and power supply to the powered hub
- Ensure the hub supports sufficient power delivery for your camera model
- Check camera's power indicator lights to confirm adequate power supply

**RTMP connection failed**
- Verify RTMP URL and stream key
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure firewall allows RTMP traffic

**YouTube Studio WebView Issues**
- **"Outdated browser" message**: Fixed with Safari 17.1 User-Agent (automatic)
- **Login not working**: Clear WebView data in iOS Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data
- **Keyboard covering content**: Custom keyboard accessory automatically handles this
- **Layout freezing**: Adaptive layout prevents UI disruption during keyboard events
- **Features not working**: All desktop YouTube Studio features are supported with enhanced WebView

**Frame drops during streaming**
- Lower bitrate settings (use 480p for better stability)
- Switch to more stable network connection
- Close other apps to free memory and CPU resources
- Use 720p maximum for optimal performance on iPad devices

**Performance optimization**
- 1080p settings are automatically downscaled to 720p
- 480p recommended for slower devices or limited bandwidth
- Hardware acceleration is automatically enabled when available

**Portrait mode / UI layout issues**
- This app currently supports **landscape mode only**
- Portrait mode may cause UI layout problems (portrait mode support is under development)
- For now, rotate your iPad to landscape orientation before using the app
- Streaming performance is currently optimized for landscape orientation

### Debug Logs

Use Xcode console with these filters:
```
🎥        # All streaming logs
[RTMP]    # RTMP connection logs
[CAMERA]  # Camera system logs
```

## 🔧 Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Ensure you have Xcode 16.3+
xcode-select --install

# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd USBExternalCamera-iOS

# Open project
open USBExternalCamera.xcodeproj
```

### Code Style

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI for all new UI components
- Implement proper error handling with async/await
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### Testing

```bash
# Build for device
xcodebuild -scheme USBExternalCamera -destination 'platform=iOS,name=Your-Device'

# Note: Physical device required for camera functionality
# Simulator testing is limited to UI components only
```

### 🚧 Future Development Plans

- **Portrait Mode Support**: Currently under development to support both landscape and portrait orientations
- **Enhanced UI Layouts**: Improved responsive design for different screen orientations
- **Additional Camera Features**: More camera controls and settings
- **Performance Improvements**: Continued optimization for various iPad models
